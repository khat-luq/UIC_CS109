%%% Your data loading code goes here

load solar_data.mat % Loads the solar panel performance data collected from sunrise to sunset

%%% Your code for solving the problem and assigning values to the specified variable names goes here

monitoring_duration = length(time_of_day); % Calculates the number of hours monitored
peak_power = max(power_output); % Calculates the maximum power output
avg_power_fullday = mean(power_output); % Calculates the average power for the full day
total_energy_wh = sum(power_output); % Calculates the total energy generated by the solar panel during the monitoring period
avg_power_peak = mean(power_output(5:9)); % Calculates the average power during peak hours (10:00 AM to 3:00 PM)

%%% Your code for displaying the results goes here

% The functions below display their respective variables with the following format: "TITLE: [value] (units)"
disp("Monitoring Duration: " + monitoring_duration + " hours") % Displays the number of hours monitored
disp("Peak Power Output: " + peak_power + " W") % Displays the maximum power output
disp("Average Power (Full Day): " + avg_power_fullday + " W") % Displays the average power for the full day
disp("Total Energy Generated: " + total_energy_wh + " Wh") % Displays the total energy generated by the solar panel
disp("Average Power (Peak Hours): " + avg_power_peak + " W") % Displays the average power during peak hours
