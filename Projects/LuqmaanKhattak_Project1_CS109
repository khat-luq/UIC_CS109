%%% Your data loading code goes here

load('tempdata.mat'); % Loads the 5 variables each for Temperature and Time as temp_# and time_# respectively (with # representing the index count)


%%% Your code for solving the problem and assigning values to the specified variable names goes here

timeMinutes_1 = time_1 / 60; 
timeMinutes_2 = time_2 / 60; 
timeMinutes_3 = time_3 / 60; 
timeMinutes_4 = time_4 / 60; 
timeMinutes_5 = time_5 / 60; % Converts the time variables provided from seconds to minutes and stores them into each timeMinutes variable.

% Time Duration Calculations (Minutes):
duration_12 = timeMinutes_2 - timeMinutes_1; % Duration between time intervals 1 and 2 in minutes.
duration_23 = timeMinutes_3 - timeMinutes_2; % Duration between time intervals 2 and 3 in minutes.
duration_34 = timeMinutes_4 - timeMinutes_3; % Duration between time intervals 3 and 4 in minutes.
duration_45 = timeMinutes_5 - timeMinutes_4; % Duration between time intervals 4 and 5 in minutes.

% Ramp Rate Calculations:
rate_12 = (temp_2 - temp_1) / duration_12; % Calculation of the 'Temperature Change (Celsius) / Time (Minutes)' between intervals 1 and 2.
rate_23 = (temp_3 - temp_2) / duration_23; % Calculation of the 'Temperature Change (Celsius) / Time (Minutes)' between intervals 2 and 3.
rate_34 = (temp_4 - temp_3) / duration_34; % Calculation of the 'Temperature Change (Celsius) / Time (Minutes)' between intervals 3 and 4.
rate_45 = (temp_5 - temp_4) / duration_45; % Calculation of the 'Temperature Change (Celsius) / Time (Minutes)' between intervals 4 and 5.

% Rate Statistics Calculations:
rate_min2 = min(rate_12, rate_23); 
rate_min1 = min(rate_min2, rate_34); 
rate_min = min(rate_min1, rate_56); % Determines the smallest integer value of the all rate variables.

rate_max2 = max(rate_12, rate_23); 
rate_max1 = max(rate_max2, rate_34); 
rate_max = max(rate_max1, rate_56); % Determines the largest integer value of the all rate variables.

rate_mean = (rate_12 + rate_23 + rate_34 + rate_45) / 4; % Determines the average integer value from all the calculated rate values.

rate_range = rate_max - rate_min; % Determines the rate range value (difference between the maximum and minimum) as an integer from the above array.


%%% Your code for displaying the results goes here
disp("Minimum Rate: " + rate_min + " °C/min")
disp("Maximum Rate: " + rate_max + " °C/min")
disp("Mean Rate: " + rate_mean + " °C/min")  
disp("Rate Range: " + rate_range + " °C/min") % These previous 4 blocks all display the titles Minimum Rate, Maximum Rate, Mean Rate, and Rate Range with their respective values in the following format: "TITLE: [value] °C/min".
