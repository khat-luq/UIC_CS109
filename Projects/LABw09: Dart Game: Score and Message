function [scoreForYellow,message] = DartGame(yellow);
% The following determines the score for the yellow region and assigns its appropriate score.
    if (yellow <= 1);
        scoreForYellow = 0;
    elseif (yellow == 2);
        scoreForYellow = 10;
    elseif (yellow < 5);
        scoreForYellow = 20;
    elseif (yellow < 9);
        scoreForYellow = 50;

    end
% The following displays the message for the appropriate score following the format "Congratulations, you get $[scoreForYellow]" UNLESS the score is less than 10, in which case two special messages appear.
    % TEST CASE: Assume the player has landed greater than 2 but less than 5 darts in the yellow region (earning them a score of 20 points).
    % EXPECTED OUTPUT:
        % scoreForYellow = 20
        % message = "Congratulations, you get $20"

        message = "You did not win any money. Wish you better luck next time!";

        message = "You did not win any money, but you get free ice cream!";
    else (scoreForYellow >= 20);
        message = "Congratulations, you get $" + scoreForYellow;
