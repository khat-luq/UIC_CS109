%-------------------------------------------

function adjacentRepeat = HasAdjacentRepeat(inArray) 
% Starts the initial count for the number of elements in 'inArray'.    
numElements = numel(inArray)
    % Assigns the default value for 'adjacentRepeat' to be 0. This may be changed by the code below.
    adjacentRepeat = 0;
    % The following creates an index starting from 2 to the end of the 'inArray' array.
    for i = 2:length(inArray)
        % This checks the equivalancy of a specific element of the array (starting from 2 to the end) to see if it is equal to the element offset by 1 (in other words, the previous element) and assigns its adjacentRepeat value to 0 if the condition ever holds true.
        if inArray(i) == inArray(i-1)
            adjacentRepeat = 1;
        end
    end
